Testing the cross compiler with the test mentioned in getting started pdf works

Added symbolic links from l4vcpu-rtems4.11-* to i386-rtems4.11-* in
/opt/rtems-4.11/bin

Added l4vcpu in c/src/aclocal/rtems-cpu-subdirs.m4

Added l4vcpu in config.sub

--- above is critical -- 



Added symbolic link to wrapper_1.h in back_rtems/cpukit/score/cpu/l4vcpu/rtems/score/ and added the include in 'interrupts.h' in the same folder

Added wrapper_1.h file mentioned above in cpukit/score/cpu/l4vcpu/Makefile.am

--enable-maintainer-mode :
  Makefile.am changes will be written out to Makefile.in

add libl4rtems.a.o to l4vcpu-rtems4.11/pc386/lib/
results in more specific `undefined reference` errors

+++ TODO +++

  add in the l4 header files to complete the compile process!
    The cpukit/score/cpu/l4vcpu/rtems/l4 folder has to be created with an extra
      command. Or the make process will fail with 'no file or directory'.
      Or, the wrapper needs to be moved to ../l4vcpu/rtems/score/
    The include paths for the wrapper need to be fixed, so it can be cleanly
      included.

The libl4rtems.o.a library needs to be linked completly in the l4 environment,
so there are no Undefined symbols left in the symbol table. 
There are various ways I to achieve this, but I don't know which one will work,
so I just list them:
* -z defs  //if shared_library undef symbols still allowed
// if shared:
* -Bstatic ++ -shared ++ --unresolved-symbols=report-all
* -Bsymbolic


WTF Moment of the hour!
src/l4/mk/lib.mk:78  :: LDSCRIPT_INCR ?= /dev/null
  so actually we do NOT have a incremental linker script?

l4rtems_outport / _inport / _out / _in
  * needs implementation
  * hooks in /c/src/lib/libcpu/l4vcpu/cpu.h
  => put impl in the library file or in the wrapper?

l4rtems_irq_restore / ++
  * implemented in wrapper_1.h but 'undefined reference' error
  => put impl in the library file? 
    * But functionality of the wrapper needed
    * How can I add the wrapper to the libl4rtems library?

moving l4rtems_irq_disable_save as a dummy function to libl4rtems/l4rtems_io.c
and adding the function name to global.syms solves the undefined references,
but I can't use it there, because the l4_vcpu_state_t needs to be in the
wrapper_1.c file. I need to structure the code, so I can provide a library to
rtems and run it on l4re --> THinK!
