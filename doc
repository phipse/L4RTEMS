Testing the cross compiler with the test mentioned in getting started pdf works

Added symbolic links from l4vcpu-rtems4.11-* to i386-rtems4.11-* in
/opt/rtems-4.11/bin

Added l4vcpu in c/src/aclocal/rtems-cpu-subdirs.m4

Added l4vcpu in config.sub around line 319, to the "i*86 | x86_64" option

--- above is critical -- 



Added symbolic link to wrapper_1.h in 
back_rtems/cpukit/score/cpu/l4vcpu/rtems/score/ 
and added the include in 'interrupts.h' in the same folder

Added wrapper_1.h file mentioned above in cpukit/score/cpu/l4vcpu/Makefile.am

--enable-maintainer-mode :
  Makefile.am changes will be written out to Makefile.in

add libl4rtems.a.o to l4vcpu-rtems4.11/pc386/lib/
results in more specific `undefined reference` errors

+++ TODO +++

  add in the l4 header files to complete the compile process!
    The cpukit/score/cpu/l4vcpu/rtems/l4 folder has to be created with an extra
      command. Or the make process will fail with 'no file or directory'.
      Or, the wrapper needs to be moved to ../l4vcpu/rtems/score/
    The include paths for the wrapper need to be fixed, so it can be cleanly
      included.
--- DONE ---      


08/07/2012
The libl4rtems.o.a library needs to be linked completly in the l4 environment,
so there are no Undefined symbols left in the symbol table. 
There are various ways I to achieve this, but I don't know which one will work,
so I just list them:
* -z defs  //if shared_library undef symbols still allowed
// if shared:
* -Bstatic ++ -shared ++ --unresolved-symbols=report-all
* -Bsymbolic


WTF Moment of the hour!
src/l4/mk/lib.mk:78  :: LDSCRIPT_INCR ?= /dev/null
  so actually we do NOT have a incremental linker script? 


09/07/2012
l4rtems_outport / _inport / _out / _in
  * needs implementation
  * hooks in /c/src/lib/libcpu/l4vcpu/cpu.h
  => put impl in the library file or in the wrapper?

l4rtems_irq_restore / ++
  * implemented in wrapper_1.h but 'undefined reference' error
  => put impl in the library file? 
    * But functionality of the wrapper needed
    * How can I add the wrapper to the libl4rtems library?


10/07/2012

moving l4rtems_irq_disable_save as a dummy function to libl4rtems/l4rtems_io.c
and adding the function name to global.syms solves the undefined references,
but I can't use it there, because the l4_vcpu_state_t needs to be in the
wrapper_1.c file. I need to structure the code, so I can provide a library to
rtems and run it on l4re --> THinK!


12/07/2012

Through which interface does the vCPU-Guest (RTEMS) and the vCPU-Host (L4Re)
communicate?
When I link staticaly the l4rtems.o.a into RTEMS, I don't get the address of
my L4Re code. I get the address of the code linked into RTEMS and this code
doesn't have a connection to L4Re anymore. So how do I implement the vcpu-exit,
which is caught by the vCPU-handler on the host system?
Where do I place the exit reason? --> is_irq_entry() ->i()->label


What I should do:
Define a structure in L4Re to share with RTEMS during startup. To do this,
store the pointer to the structure in a vCPU register. As we are in the same
address space this works fine. I just have to include the libvcpu-header file,
so RTEMS knows the structure of the vCPU. As the shared structure grows, I have
to include more headers. But we will see that when the time is right.


14/12/2012

I added a shared variable structure to the RTEMS_wrapper and stored it in edx
of the vCPU. I isn't used in start.S directly and I hope I can extract the
pointer to this shared structure in bootcard with a litte bit of inline asm. 
But bootcard is shared over all BSPs so specific changes for one bsp should
NOT go in there.
It would be best practice to declare the sharedVar variable somewhere inside
the l4vcpuBsp and save the pointer at the beginning of the start.S file, as
this is BSP specific. How do I declare extern variables in ASM? Just with
"EXTERN _varname" or does this only work for functions?
And the second question is, where to store the variable in the first place.
Maybe it would be best to write a special file.

I already added custome functions for inport/outport in 
c/src/lib/libcpu/l4vcpu/cpu.h. I copied the old i386 methods back, so I can
focus on a more specific set of problems without side effects from linker
errors.
Result: Only a few 'undefined reference' errors remain

I removed the previously added libl4rtems.o.a from the build dir.
I also removed l4rtems_inch/_ouch from libbsp/l4vcpu/pc386/console/console.c
Now onyle the 'undefined reference to irq_disable/endable' errors remain.

I placed the sharedVariableStruct together with the wrapper_1.h include in the
pc386/startup/bspgeworkarea.c file and defined it extern in start/start.S.
==> I have a include problem, so the sharedvars_t is not recognised. 


15/07/2012

First thing on a sunday morning: 'typedef' seems to be a C++ construct and is
not recognized by RTEMS. I exchanged it with 'struct guestHostShare. Now it
compiles fine.

Now I move libvcpu/include/vcpu.h into the cpukit/score/rtems/l4vcpu tree and
include it in interrupts.h, as I need it for the enable/disable interrupt
functionality.
Due to this change I need all l4 dependencies in the RTEMS tree, which I
modified to only search for local headers and prefixed all with l4, so they
don't collide with RTEMS includes.
So now I got a complete set of necessary l4 includes, mostly from l4sys and
l4sys/ARCH_x86. I added and modified the includes of all files; l4utcb.h and
l4utcb_x86.h have been a bit tricky, as they depend on each other and the compiler
doesn't overwrite weak declarations. Additionally the l4_utcb_t is not found in
l4utcb_x86.h, so I copied it over.

Some errors bound to the change in interrupts.h still remain. 
>> error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
I think the declaration: 'extern struct guestHostShare *sharedVariableStruct'
is not working correctly. 

I needed to add the wrapper.h to the interrupts.h file and to include vcpu.h in
the wrapper.h.
I don't know how to handle the last two parameters of 'l4vcpu_irq_restore' -
'do_event_work_cb' and 'setup_ipc'. I just work with NULL for both of them, to keep
going.

Moved the 'l4rtems_vcpu_irq_state' to 'getbspworkarea.c' and declared it as
'extern' in interrupts.h, as it throws multiple definition errors.

And the added NULL value for 'setup_ipc' and 'do_event_work_cb' is already
falling on my feet...


16/07/2012

No it wasn't. The undefined reference to l4_ipc_wait was due to the missing
implementation file, as it's an architecture specific file. Additionally I need
to remove the header of l4_ipc_wait in l4ipc.h and add the include of
l4ipc-invoke-x86.h and l4ipc-l42-gcc3-nopic.h(order matters). 
This leads to an undefined reference of __l4sys_invoke_direct, which should be
provided by the linker itself in the linkerscript. 
L4Re provides it in ldscripts/generic.h as __l4sys_invoke_direct =
__L4_KIP_ADDR__ + 0x800. The __L4_KIP_ADDR__ is provided by the buildsystem in
l4/mk/prog.mk, which grabs the variable from l4/mk/Makeconf.
>> The question is: How do I get this address into RTEMS?


I need to implement the 'do_event_work_cb' and it should point to the RTEMS irq
handler, as the check for a pending irq is already done.



16/8/2012

I had a look into the 'do_event_work_cb' issue. The best way to handle this
seems to be the 'bsp_interrupt_handler_dispatch', as this routine looks up the
vector number in the IDT and returns the right handler. 
Now I just need to find out, where the IRQ number is stored by l4vcpu.
The number is still where it belongs. The pending irq flag just tells, there is
a IRQ to read, please read it. The handler should read it and pass the right
number on to the dispatch function in RTEMS. Further on the interrupt controler
will be customised. Which provides us with access to the IDT seen by RTEMS.

The __l4sys_invoke_direct address has to be written into the linker as a
definition. As the number is fixed in x86 it can be a hard coded magic number.

So far I added a PROVIDE in the linkcmds in libbsp/l4vcpu/pc386/startup/ for
the __l4sys_invoke_direct and hardcoded the magic number for the x86 platform.
Additionaly I fixed the wrapper_1.cc/.h files.
It compiles all the samples, but when I load the hello-sample into the l4vcpu
environment, it traps when starting _load_segemnts in pc386/startup/ldsegs.S.



17/08/2012

The trap was due to a general protection fault, as RTEMS tries to set up the
GDT and IDT, including CS and DS. All this can only be done by the kernel in
ring 0, so it raises a general protection fault.
As fiasco already dealt with this, we have no need for this, and can jump right
to the next step. 



20/08/2012

Next: UTCB access crashes and I need to setup a BIOS like environment, so RTEMS
can read VIDEO_MODE_ADDR and possibly some other values too.
Well, ignore the VIDEO_MODE_ADDR stuff in IBMPC_initVideo and use uart or serial.



21/08/2012
The UTCB access might not be the problem. I discovered a mov operation moving a
value to eax, which moves a zero or nothing. So this might be the real problem.



22/08/2012
The missing value is my sharedVariableStruct, which contains the pointer to the
vcpu for interrupt handling. This value is stored in %edx by the wrapper and
should be read by the bootcode of RTEMS. But it's still ZERO after the
operation. 
After initializing the sharedVariableStruct in RTEMS with 1 instead of 0 the
addres changed and it magically worked. If you initialize with 0 it is moved to
the .bss segment, if initalized with 1 somewhere else. This is really hacky
stuff, but it works.

++++ TODO ++++ The wrapper code of the main function needs to be structured.
It's all messy.
---- DONE ----

The execution of the RTEMS_Guest stopps, when RTEMS tries to initialize the
timer, because the 'inport' and 'outport' routines aren't handled yet. I added
l4rtems_inport/outport to the wrapper and modified
i386_inport_byte/word/long and i386_outport_byte/word/long with a call to
l4rtems_{in/out}port.



23/08/2012
I added my library functions to rtems with 'ar r librtemscpu.a libl4rtems.o.a'.
That is very hacky, but I haven't found the right way to place an additional
library in the rtems build. This introduced another phdr into the elf file of
the hello-sample with the type GNU_STACK. At the moment I simply ignore it and
it seems to work.

++++ TODO ++++ 
Find a way to add libraries to RTEMS.
---- Done ---- 

++++ TODO ++++ 
Modify wrapper.cc::load_elf() function to load more than one phdr.

I have to give the in/out-port thingy a second look, as the pending operation
tries to send data to a port. I think I need to grab a capability for this port
first.
So the inport/outport methods have to keep track of the port-capabilities and
aquire a new one, if they don't have it.


24/08/2012
Timer: Either I write a virtual interface for the hardware timer or I write a
software timer for RTEMS and adjust the RTEMS code.
The port stuff, should throw a GPF, as the Task doesn't have the rights to
write to that port, but it doesn't.

Console: I have a growing need of initalizing a console to get some debugging
output directly from the RTEMS guest.

IDT: The rtems_irq_mngt_init fails, as we didn't set a IDT.


30/08/2012
The l4rtems_timer got a default period of 1ms, but the caller is able to
define it's own period length in milliseconds <ms>. Default was chosen due to
the call to 'calibrate 1ms loop' function at RTEMS startup.

=== Console
The sharedVariableStruct gets extended to pass the framebuffer parameters to
RTEMS, which are needed to initialize the RTEMS console. The initVideo routine
was rewritten and tailored to virtual interface.

I did some adaptions in the outch.c file, to support 'unsigned long' datatypes
(less casting) and some followup rewrite in videoAsm.S to ensure these changes
don't cause problems. (Need somebody to check the asm code!)

In start.S I replaced the call to _IBMPC_initVideo with my _L4RTEMS_initVideo
and it looks like the sharedVariableStruct doesn't store the pointer - again.
Maybe this is due to the additional tasks running to provide IO and framebuffer
functionality, but I am not sure. 

The wrapper initializes a goos_fb and stores the necessary values in the
guestHostStruct.


31/08/2012
Thanks to Björn, I discovered my fault. I dereferenced the pointer not often
enough, I fixed it by storing the pointer to the datastructure in EDX and not
the pointer to the pointer to the datastructure.. .
Following nice output in the framebuffer the 'wr_curser' method brings
problems, as it wants to talk to outports. But the framebuffer is handled by
L4Re and so I need to replace it.

== Console
Easy way: just reroute the output to l4re and let it handle the printing.
Difficult way: Fiddle with the framebuffer and work with the disadvantages.
Choose: Easy way! ==> wr_curser stuff unnecessary

== IDT
Hardware IDT isn't necessary, only the stuff that sets up the table in
software, so the handler can address it. So give the rtems_irq_mngt_init a
closer look.

== Handler
Needs to move into RTEMS, for effective IRQ handling.

== Timer IRQ
Works, but as interrupts are disabled, there is no current use.

++++ TODO ++++ interrupts.h
  replace the NULL parts in l4vcpu_irq_restore!
---- DONE ----



03/09/2012
== Console
Third way: use serial interface / uart.

== Interrupt extension
RTEMS has an interrupt abstraction layer, called 'interrupt extension' defined
in libbsp/shared/include/irq-generic.h . There are the needs for minimal IRQ
handling defined. 

I removed all hardware related interrupt init code in shared/irq/irq-init.c 
and hope,there is no direct call from the higher level code to these entries.
Well, there is an outport call at BSP_irq_enable_at_i8259s, so this can't work
yet. But apart from this, it looks fine.

== bsp_start_default
killed PCI and IDE init, as it is unnecessary right now. I need to get the
interrupt stuff working first.
It works!
Back at the boot_card startup sequence, the
bootcard_bsp_libc_helper/bsp_libc_init function is causing trouble. It calls
RTEMS_Malloc_Initialize but on the way it crashes into an unhandled 'cli'
instruction. I have no idea how it gets there, at the moment, but now I fix the
printk output.



06/09/2012
== RTEMS_Malloc_Initialize
Fixed! The multiboot structure was filled with bogus numbers, so the numbers
read from it were wrong. With the current ones, I get reasonable results and
the init process advances to the keyboard driver.

== Console output:
Still no printk support, as I have no clue how to get the stdin file descriptor
inside of RTEMS. Maybe the serial bus is the way to go, but I need to read on 
this first. 

++++ TODO ++++ Fix the IDT setup.


07/09/2012
I am passing the l4 stdin/out file descriptors in the sharedVarStruct. Printk
works without error, but also without output.. .
For everything else I have to advance the interrupt handling first.

=== Educated guess
- Request every IRQ nbr, RTEMS has a handler for. So far:
    #define BSP_PERIODIC_TIMER    0
    #define BSP_KEYBOARD          1
    #define BSP_UART_COM2_IRQ	  3
    #define BSP_UART_COM1_IRQ	  4
    #define BSP_RT_TIMER1	  8
    #define BSP_RT_TIMER3	  10
- attach/detach RTEMS thread to these IRQs, when 
    bsp_interrupt_handler_install/remove is called.
- triggered IRQ forces vcpu_exit, an handler_entry and the  handler calls
    rtems_interrupt_handler_dispatch with the irq nbr.
- provide replacement for BSP_irq_enable/disable_at_i8259s
- ++OR++ provide replacement for bsp_interrupt_vector_enable/disable and make
    sure nobody wants to use BSP_irq_enable/disable_at_i8259s.

2nd step
-- handler then tries to read from in/out_port, which needs to be done through
    L4Re!?

I marked the points in l4vcpu/irq.c, where the L4Re wrapper communication is
necessary.


10/09/2012
Added the L4 routines for attaching and detaching IRQs.
Restructured the RTEMS_wrapper files: Moved a lot of code into the now C++
library.



13/09/2012
Incrementally linked libl4rtems.a without loose ends.
Still problems with output routing.



20/09/2012
L4linux and l4openbsd use a L4_EXTERNAL_FUNC routine and together with
__l4_external_resolver. To provide an interface for functions running in the
host to the guest.



27/09/2012
Next approach on the printing issue. I use an additional thread to print
everything, that's written to a shared buffer by RTEMS. The buffer and a flag
is passed in the sharedVariableStructure.
??? How do I pass arguments to l4_threads? Atm I worked around it with global
vars.

++++ TODO ++++ Add atomic compare and swap to deal with the shared flag.
---- DEPRECATED ----
--> preliminary solution: nobody can write to the buffer, before the buffer 
is written to the output

Removed some of the incrementally linked libraries, as they cause trouble.
Comment out some of my library code, too, to postpone the undefined reference
errors.

::::OUTPUT ISSUE:::: Got output with the output thread polling on the flag. 
DRAWBACKS: 
- Spinning while the output isn't consumed by l4rtems_buffOut;
- Bad performance

The spinning stuff doesn't work, as the loop never exits. Don't know why.

=== Configuration: rtmes_configuration_table
I need to find this table and how it is set up. My read is, this is done at
compile time, when the macros get evaluated. If I can get a hold on the drivers
needed for startup (keyboard, ...), I can reason about the virtualization 
design. I think this way is better than taking a driver by driver approach.

The keyboard get's initialized together with the console in console.c.
Ignoring this, leads to an error in threadhandler.c, due to an sti instruction.
I tried to change it to i386_interrupt_enable/disable but this leads to a ton
of compile errors.



1/10/2012
The compile error might be macro related. It disappears, when the one operation
in the if-branch is sourrounded by braces.
Implemented i386_flash_interrupts, but push %(level); popf; cli; doesn't 
necessarily enable interrupts, so my implementation is far away from stable.

Added another thread to provide keyboard input to the guest. Most likely not
the intended behaivour of this kind of virtualization solution, but it's a
first try.
Somehow I end up, at bsp_reset. 
--> At the end of the programm. Yay! But output is missing! 
Well, the output was there, just not there. Printf is directing somewhere else
than printk. So Hello World with printk instead of printf shows everything on
the right console. 



12/10/2012
I extended the sharedVariableStruct with a buffer size variable for the I/O
buffers.
And I redesigned the whole output thing. I don't need an output thread with
busy waiting anymore. A small drawback is the missing color atm.

::: Interesting behaviour
In bspreset.c is a call 'outport_byte(0x64, 0xFE)', which uses the outb
instruction and resets the whole L4 task. I replaced it with a while loop to
prevent the reboot. 
Actually the outb instruction should trigger a general protection fault and
drop into the handler.



15/10/2012
Modified the l4_log_print_srv to l4_vcon_write.
NULL parameters in l4_irq_restore replaced with handler and setup_ipc. 
To achieve this the handler needs to be moved inside of RTEMS.
Moving the handler to a seperate file first and later into the RTEMS.
setup_ipc: empfangsbuffer vorbereiten, nur relevant, wenn man server ist. 
Added l4thread.h and l4util.h to the l4vcpu/rtems/l4vcpu include list and to
the corresponding makefile.
I moved the handler.c into the startup directory of the BSP:
l4vcpu/pc386/startup/ and the handler.h into score/cpu/l4vcpu/rtems/l4vcpu.

Well, seems to work, but the handler can't be invoked, as the address
is currently not read. 
++++ TODO: get the handler IP from the loaded elf file.
---- DEPRECATED!



19/10/2012
To get the IP of the handler, we need to read the symbol table entries, until
we find the right one, but where the heck do I get this entry?
I try to hack my way through the section header table, but it's messy and takes
time.



22/10/2012
Discarded the changes made last time. RTEMS now initializes the vcpu->entry_ip
by itself as soon as start_bsp() is invoked. 
This is safe, because the vcpu starts with disabled IRQs and pagefaults can't
occure, so there won't be an vcpu exit until the entry_ip and therefore the
exception handler is set. 


26/10/2012
Revised the l4rtems_inch function. Now it uses l4_vcon_read to read a whole
buffsize and returns it char by char, until its own buffer is empty. 

I added the pointer to the l4re environment to the shared structure, in order
to gain access to capability allocation. 
++++ TODO
Add l4re_global_env as global variable for the l4re functionality
---- DONE



29/10/2012
I declared a global variable l4re_global_env (IMPORTANT: same name as in l4re!)
and set it in the bspstart routine to the l4re_global_env value passed in the
shared struct.
Unfortunatly the incremental linking process for libl4rtems.o.a already
declared a fixed symbol with that name, hence the l4re routines never used the
rtems-declared one. So I needed to use object files for the incremental linking
instead of full libraries. For details see
l4/pkg/RTEMS_wrapper/lib/src/Makefile.

I implemented a setup_ipc method, which does nothing, just to prevent a NULL
pointer. 
Additionally I am missing timer interrupts in the vcpu. To enable interrupts
the first time, we need a call to l4vcpu_irq_enable, and not .._restore.
After calling irq_enable at the end of the hello world routine, I get endless
handler entries, whose reason I don't know. 
Did bogus. Implemented an extra handleIrq function, to provide as a callback
function to l4vcpu_irq_enable/restore.

Interrupt labels: Nicht die beiden unteren bits verwenden. Nur wenn
Absenderrechte interessant sind, dann anschauen: Maskieren, unmaskieren.


02/11/2012
BEWARE: L4 and RTEMS have different calling conventions for function calls! So
L4 is passing all arguments on the stack and RTEMS awaits some in registers. If
you don't consider this, you might need a lot of time until your tutor comes up
with the idea. 
So I changed the calling conventions of the vcpu exit handler aka
l4rtems_handler to l4_fastcall.


==== INTERMEZZO ====
open TODO from above:
+ Fix the IDT setup.

next step TODO:
+ init keyboard driver -- done
+ get printf working --> it get's rendered, and we don't have a framebuffer
+ fix the issue with l4vcpu_irq_restore --> modify saved state
+ get more examples to work


=== keyboard driver issue ===
We don't need to initialize keyboard hardware. So we can skip that and try to
grab a l4 capability for the keyboard. 
During this try I discovered a fault in my l4rtems_requestIrq implementation,
as I can't attach to the new vector. I am missing l4io_request_irq to get this
working, and this one needs printf. So the printf issue just got boosted in
priority.



09/11/2012
The error of l4io_request_irq seems to come from the missing IO server. I
implemented this one, updated wrapper.cfg and modules.list, added a vbus
configuration, but it still doesn't work.
Some testing showed, that the IO server doens't start up properly, when the
wrapper is started. As I don't know yet how to tell Ned to delay the start, I
added a second sleep to the wrapper.

The missing dealy was due to a missing initialisation routine, executed by libc
before main. Due to this we decided to move the attach/detach functionality
into the wrapper and let the guest execute a vm exit. More specific a the
instruction 'hlt' with 5 parameters in the cpu registers.

So and now we see, that this is not the way to do it.

So I will port the solution from L4Linux and L4OpenBSD. Buzzword: external
resolver.



23/11/2012
I port the __l4_external_resolver functionality of L4Linux to L4RTEMS. 
This includes serveral files from l4linux/arch/l4/boot/* and the Makefile-magic
generating func_list.h. 

This changes the compile process into three steps:
1. Build libl4rtems.a of RTEMS_wrapper/lib/src/
2. Build RTEMS and add libl4rtems.a
3. Build RTEMS_wrapper with the analysis of the RTEMS binary

These three steps are not so nice at the moment and that adds another
++++ TODO ++++
  add libl4rtems.a to the buildprocess of RTEMS --obsolete

On the RTEMS side we got new files: 
- stringify.h, 
- l4lib.h
containing string magic and the L4_EXTERNAL_FUNC macro.

ERRORS:
- The wrapper Makefile still needs the func_list.h and res.c magic
- The RTEMS binary seems to be missing the .data.l4externals.* parts

DEBUG:
- handler.o contains the .data.l4externals.* and .text.l4externals.str sections
- librtemsbsp.a contains the sections
- binary at least contains the *_resolve functions (e.g.
  l4rtems_requestIrq_resolve).


24/11/2012
The linkcmds shoves all .data.* sections into the .data section. Hence, the
.data.l4externals.* sections disappeared in the final binary. 
Next the func_list.h generated by the Makefile isn't found by gcc. So I added
a symbolic link from the source to the build dir of the RTEMS_wrapper.
+++ This is NOT final!

After this, the clash between C and C++ surfaced again and I added a "#ifdef
__cplusplus extern "C" " wrapper around __l4_external_resolver and
do_resolve_error.
Finally it compiles. But running the whole showes a read page fault @0. So
there is still work.

My guess is, the func_list.h stuff isn't 100% working.



28/11/2012
gcc with -E flag shows the right behaviour of res.c and func_list.h.
But l4rtems_requestIrq is never invoked. So the address translation fails.
Not even C__l4_external_resolver is invoked.
Yeah, you should initialize __l4_external_resolver variable in RTEMS. Done that
now in pc386/startup/bspstart.c.

The transition to the L4-Task world works now. But I get an invalid capability
from Util::cap_alloc.alloc in l4rtems_requestIrq. 



30/11/2012
Well, if you are programming it right, then it works... .
Valid cap, but bind fails with -17 aka object exists.
Somebody grabs the 0x1 IRQ from IO before I do. So the IRQ is not available
anymore.

LESSON LEARNED: Never assume your code isn't doing this'n'that. Check it!
(Quote Zombieland: Double Tap!)
I had an old call to l4io_request_irq in my wrapper code. don't know why; maybe
some old tests... .



10/12/2012
I tracked an error during opening of a console, to a missing semaphore. It was
missing due to a excluded termios_initialize. Now it seems to work.
Just the detachIrq method doesn't work.

Fixed detachIrq by introducing a irqNbr -> Capability map on the stack. If I
put it on the heap I run into memory issues while loading the RTEMS elf-binary.

So I am moving on to another example in the hope of more faults :)
I choose the base_sp sample.
And I changed the wrapper source code, so I can use a symbolic link on the
current RTEMS executable.

Error: init system clock
  due to failing request on IRQ 0
    Which makes sense, as we don't give access to the timer to the guest.
So we have to build our own timer suite to provide communication.



17/12/2012
I programmed my own trivial timer thread and adapted the request/detach IRQ
interface, to provide the timerIRQ to RTEMS.

18/12/2012
I rewrote the timer interface, so there is a new header file timer.h in
RTEMS_wrapper/include/ and the corresponding source file timer.cc is in
RTEMS_wrapper/server/src. The functions in the src file share a global struct,
which is implemented as a singelton. Just some sanity is missing here. 

++++ TODO: add the sanity checks to the timer functions!


07/12/2012
After some reading in l4vcpu/pc386/timer/timer.c, I wrote a l4rtems_timer.c,
which implements an initialization routine to tailor the timer into the
interrupt descriptor table. Additionally there are functions, calling the my
previously written L4Re routines in the RTEMS_wrapper package.
The timer.h file from L4Re got placed in cpukit/score/cpu/l4vcpu/rtems/l4vcpu/
and provides function headers. 
L4_EXTERNAL_FUNC is used, to tailor guest and host.

So far it compiles, but I haven't looked, where it stops executing. That's
next.


08/12/2012
Adam suggested to look at the l4linux timer implementation. There the timer
thread is a timer server and is called via IPC. The server waits for an IPC for
a predefined period of time. If this times out the timer IRQ is triggered and
the server waits again for the next timeout. 
OR
If the server recieves an IPC different from the timeout, it checks the
protocol and either starts the timer or stops it, by setting the timeout to a
value different to L4_IPC_NEVER or the very same.
This describes the server loop. Besides there are functions providing the
interface to start and stop the server, which emit an IPC to the server with
the expected values.
Additionaly there is a function to set the timer mode and an init routine for
aquiring the IRQ_cap and starting the timer thread.

This design allows starting and stopping of the timer and different timer
modes. Compared to my current timer for RTEMS, I am missing these three things.
Also the server design is better than my monolithic aproach.


14/12/2012
Well C++11 support seems to be an issue in L4. Strongly typed 'enum class'
constructs seem to break the assumption of 'int'-opcodes/protocol codes for
IPCs. So my timer implementation isn't quite working yet. 



25/01/2013
I implemented a Timer-server derived from L4::Server<Hooks> and custom made
Hooks for the server. A periodic timeout is implemented via the timeout_hook
and two additional functions are provided to provide an IPC interface for
starting and stopping the timer.
The function headers are passed to RTEMS in a header file and the function
definitions are accessed via L4_EXTERNAL_FUNC.

At the moment, RTEMS grabs the IRQ0 in the clock/ckinit.c file, which doesn't
start the timer.

Well and the thread setup for the timer, shouldn't be done from the RTEMS
path of execution, seriously.



26/01/2013
Now I got what I was doing wrong. I didn't aquire the timer_thread_cap and
didn't create a new thread with it in the factory. So there was no new thread,
that can be switched to and therefore the execution registers were just
replaced in the current thread. 
Right now I have to get a clue, what RTEMS is doing with the load of interrupt
handling and clock and timer device code. As the i386 bsp is using deprecated
functionality, I have to go down the rabit hole and see where it all ends.



27/01/2013
After following the chain of function calls from the driver initialization I
wrote a new clock initialization routine, which doesn't use the deprecated
BSP_install_rtems_irq_handler function anymore. This skips one function call
and the l4rtems_timer gets initialized successfully.

Now some video code is generating pagefaults.
The init sequence of the keyboard wants to write via console_write, which in
turn calls rtems_termios_write or - in our case - ibmpc_console_write. This
calls _IBMPC_outch calling videoPutChar, which pagefaults, as a pointer - to
the framebuffer - is null.



28/01/2013
l4_vcon_read/write are now used from within RTEMS, via l4rtems_inch/outch.
l4rtems_outch is buffered, to provide less congestion on vcon.

Additionally I implemented l4rtems_console.c, which provides the driver entry
points to the RTEMS console driver. Mostly just stubs for now, as I haven't
thought about the L4 side yet.

31/01/2013
Test the timer mechanism seperatly.



01/02/2013
So after learning that some modularized components are made to be stacked
together, I had to rewrite the L4rtems_timer implementation. 
Now I have a L4rtems_timer class derived from Server_object, implementing a
dispatch function and an error handling function.
A Basic_registry is modified such it is only handling the L4rtems_timer server
object.
So every call to the server is directed to the registry, is passed on to the
timer.

But there are some utcb issues to be resolved at the moment.



08/02/2013
Learned some more about utcb and the vcpu control registers. The utcb issue is
solved now. The L4rtems_timer_server was instatiated from the wrapper thread.
This thread goes to sleep, after it has done the setup. When the timer now
looks for messages in the utcb it looks in this one and should be looking in
the one of the timer thread. So all I had to do was instantiate the server from
the thread, which is calling the server.loop().

But as the timer thread has it's own utcb and therefore it's own capability
table. So I need to do an IPC to pass the timerIRQ from the wrapper's setup to
the timer thread, after it is created.
But I need a special setup_wait functionality to pass capabilities via IPC.



20/02/2013
Wrong assumption. The cap-table ist stored process wise, not thread wise. So
the error I was seeing was in fact no error. It was the lable of the stream, as
l4_error is checking the msgtag and if no error is found, it returns the ipc
label. So I use l4_ipc_error now and it works as it should.



22/02/2013
One Error is nice, but if you have three errors working together, then it gets
nasty. So first the right thread should call the l4_irq_attach, second the
interrupts on the vcpu should be enabled, and third you should serve all
pending interrupts BEFORE your detach from the interrupt line.
Finally the interrupt 0 is delivered to the vcpu and is recieved by RTEMS. 

TODO: - fix interrupt enable after startup -- done
      - trace why RTEMS doesn't know about the vector number. --should be fixed

The second TODO occurs, because the interrupt handler table gets cleaned up,
before the interruts are enabled. So fix the first one and it should work.



26/03/2013
After enabling the interrupt in the vcpu save state at vcpu setup time in
RTEMS_wrapper and after replacing l4vcpu_irq_disable_save with
l4vcpu_irq_disable and _restore with _replace, respectivly, I have working
interrupts. I haven't found out, why disable_save and _restore didn't work in
the intended fashion. Even when the current state shows IRQs as enabled and the
saved value shows this too, after a restore the saved value is 4 again and
stays that way.

Furthermore I adapted the Clock_isr() from libbsp/shared/clockdrv_shell.h.
I count the ticks and inform the system by invoking rtems_clock_tick().



07/04/2013
I get random page faults while executing the nsecs sample. Also new issues
with the base_sp sample arose. But they seem to arise in a random manner. This
might be related to a clock interrupt, as it was the last major change to the
source.
I followed it down the rabbit hole, to _Watchdog_Tickle_ticks() in
rtems_clock_tick(). I guess something went wrong with the
_Watchdog_Tickle_chain.
I can't figure out what goes wrong in there, as the chain is empty. I commented
it in rtems_clock_tick() so it's skipped now and everything seems to work. 
However I have a problem with the cleanup of nsecs task. It runs through, but
has trouble with sleep(1). It produces loads of GPFs...
Shutdown looks fine, though, if you leave the sleep out.



08/04/2013
At the moment the clock period is hardcoded inside the L4Re-wrapper and is not
obtained from RTEMS. But that's not the thing we want. So what options do we
have? I introduce a new field in the sharedVariableStruct or the function call
needs parameters. The latter might be the dynamic choice, but the clock period
or microseconds per tick is defined in a static way in RTEMS applications.
But the dynamic approach covers the static one too, and I don't bloat the
sharedVariableStruct.
Now the IRQ vector is requested and if successfull a l4rtems_timer_start is
issued with the configured microseconds per tick.
One can also pass a timeout until the first IRQ should fire, for all other
IRQs the period value is used.

Now I implemented a function to get the nanoseconds sinc the last tick. It's a
little bit hacky, as I just multiply the difference in microseconds with 1000.
But as a start it isn't that bad.
However, I still get the page faults from the _Watchdog_Tickle_ticks()
function.



10/04/2012
I tried the ticker example. It produces a general protection fault, because the
three tasks are blocking on purpose and the _CPU_Thread_Idle_body() function
is called. This function executes the asm command "hlt", which is a priviledged
instruction and produces the GPF. 
I tried the ugly busy waiting, but then the tasks don't get resumed, at least I
don't get any output. So I need a solution, which blocks execution, but doesn't 
use the hlt instruction. I don't want to halt the vcpu.

So there is a function called l4vcpu_wait_for_event, which blocks until an
interrupt occurs. This works as expected. The busy waiting would work too, but
I had this GPF issue mentioned earlier with _Watchdog_Tickle_ticks(), which I 
couldn't track down. So I assumed it had the same cause and included it again,
and it's shown, the GPF vanished as well.

In the meeting with Adam today, I mentioned my problems with the interrupt
handling (26/03/2013) and my fix is working, but far away from valid. So I am
back at this problem. Now I use the passed _level variable, as it stores the
old state, didn't get that before... . Additionally, I had to implement to
functions which enable and disable IRQs, without writing to the _level variable, as
_Modes_Set_interrupt_level() doesn't pass a variable, instead it passes a
number. This leads to nasty compile time errors. That vanished with the usage
of the two new functions in _ISR_Set_level.

So what remains is the interrupt enable/disable issue.
