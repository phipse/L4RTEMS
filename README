= This is all just a rough outline, under construction and will be expanded in
the future. = 




== Abstract == 

This is a student project I do at the Chair for operating systems at the
Dresden University of Technology. The goal of the project is to test the L4vcpu
implementation by running RTEMS on top of it. 


== Structure ==

On the L4Re side, I have a wrapper, loading the ELF-File compiled by RTEMS,
starting the VCPU Task and handling VM exits. This wrapper also includes an
interface acting as joint between L4Re and RTEMS. 

The RTEMS side get a new BSP and CPU called l4vcpu, which provides the
necessary adaptions from i386 to L4vcpu, like IRQ handling.



== Build instructions ==

Just follow the normal RTEMS build instructions with some minor changes:

After you bootstrapped you need to add the l4vcpu in ${RTEMS_SRC_FOLDER}/config.sub around line 354:
  Just preceed the definition of "i*86 | x86_64)" with "l4vcpu |" 

Then you should configure your build with the following parameters:
  --target=l4vcpu-rtems4.11
  --enable-rtemsbsp=pc386
everything else goes untouched.


The first try with make will fail, due to a missing directory. So you need to
add it with:
/${builddir}: mkdir l4vcpu-rtems4.11/pc386/lib/include/rtems/l4


== Further documentation ==

Please check the doc file, it is no real documentation, just a bunch of notes I
wrote down to keep track of the workflow.
